            <h2>The Cat</h2>
            <p>
              Cats have been domesticated for around 4,000 years. While they
              were once valued for their hunting abilities, they are now valued
              for their companionship and loving behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
              While not well known, the collective nouns used for cats and
              kittens are a clowder of cats and a kindle of kittens
            </p>
            <p>
              They differ from large cats such as lions and tigers because they
              are naturally active at night and can purr.
            </p>
            <p>Cats are now the most popular pet in the UK and in the US.</p>

            <h2>The Dog</h2>
            <p>
              Domestic dogs have been companions to people for more than 15,000
              years. There are more than 400 different breeds of dogs. PAWS or
              your local animal shelter has a wide variety of breeds available
              for adoption. The most popular types are the non-pedigree. They
              are extra special because they are one-of-a-kind!
            </p>
            <p>
              In general, small dogs live longer than large dogs. Small dogs
              such as terriers may live 20 years. Giant dogs like Great Danes
              may live eight years. The average lifespan for a mixed breed dog
              is 13 to 14 years. By making sure dogs have good food, regular
              veterinary care, shelter and a loving family, they will live
              longer, healthier lives.
